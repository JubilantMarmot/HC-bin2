# PicoTemp Sensor

This is a pretty cool but simple project. RGB LED and a screen that shows you the temperature. Both when it is hot and cold!

Additionally, there is a joystick for menu selection, but that is not implemented yet. This is for [redacted for privacy] school for the Electronics Club demo next Thursday.

Try it here! https://wokwi.com/projects/407498035301430273 

## Todo in the future

- Make the joystick do stuff other than reading it
- Add RTC and storage for timeseries data?
